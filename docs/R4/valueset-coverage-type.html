An estimated 7 to 10% of U.S. women of screening age are eligible to receive NBCCEDP services.

Managed care uses medical protocols and procedures agreed on by the medical profession to be cost effective, also known as medical practice guidelines.

However, there is a greater cost associated with choosing these non-network providers.

In return, the policyholder agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals.  Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party.  For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.

                        
                           Discussion:A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of  a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActCode-ANNU"> </a><a href="v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-ANNU">ANNU</a></td><td>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</td><td>annuity policy</td><td>Definition: A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.

                           Discussion: Reinsurance is a means by which an insurance company can protect itself against the risk of losses with other insurance companies. Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.

                        For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies. Also called risk control insurance or stop-loss insurance.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActCode-SURPL"> </a><a href="v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-SURPL">SURPL</a></td><td>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode</td><td>surplus line insurance policy</td><td>Definition:

Explanation of the columns that may appear on this page:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr><td>Lvl</td><td>A few code lists that FHIR defines are hierarchical - each code is assigned a level. For value sets, levels are mostly used to organize codes for user convenience, but may follow
   code system hierarchy - see <a href="codesystem.html#hierarchy">Code System</a> for further information</td></tr> 
 <tr><td>Source</td><td>The source of the definition of the code (when the value set draws in codes defined elsewhere)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Code</td><td>The code (used as the code in the resource instance). If the code is in italics, this indicates that the code is not selectable ('Abstract')</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Display</td><td>The display (used in the <i>display</i> element of a <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a>). If there is no display, implementers should not simply display the code, but map the concept into their application</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Definition</td><td>An explanation of the meaning of the concept</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Comments</td><td>Additional notes about how to use the code</td></tr>
