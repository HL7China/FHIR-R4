<p>Many FHIR resources have a status element that represents the lifecycle state of the resource or the clinical process represented by the resource. Work groups can specify status values appropriate to the individual resource. Although consistency between resources is not the primary objective, it is helpful to users and developers to have well-crafted value sets that cover all possible states (since the value sets are typically required and non-extensible).</p>

<p>To understand existing status elements, and to help create extensions and resources involving resource states, we note that status value sets follow one of the following life cycles:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clinical workflow process life cycle</li>
	<li>Request/Order  life cycle</li>
	<li>Entity status life cycle</li>
	<li>Clinical status life cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>Describes the lifecycle states of complex activities common in healthcare. Typically, these states follow a chronological life cycle that leads from initiation to the conclusion of the action.
A characteristic (but non-exhaustive) set of states for the clinical workflow process life cycle include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>planned - resources for the activity are being allocated but the activity has not begun</li>
	<li>cancelled - the planned activity did not start and will not take place</li>
	<li>in-progress - the activity has begun</li>
	<li>on-hold (suspended) - the activity has been temporarily interrupted</li>
	<li>stopped (aborted, failed) - the activity has not been completed but no future action is planned</li>
	<li>completed (finished) - the activity has been completed</li>
</ul>

<p>Some resources in FHIR represent orders or requests. The request lifecycle can be generalized in terms of four stages: creating the request, sending the request, receiving acceptance or refusal of the request, and fulfillment of the request. A characteristic (but non-exhaustive) set of states for the request/order pattern include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>proposed: An actor (e.g. a clinical decision support system) has proposed an action to be requested</li>
 <li>draft: The request is in preliminary form, prior to being requested</li>
 <li>requested: The request has been made</li>
 <li>rejected: The request receiver has declined the request</li>
 <li>accepted: The request receiver has accepted the request</li>
 <li>in-progress: Work to fulfill the request has begun</li>
 <li>on-hold (suspended): Work on the request has been interrupted</li>
 <li>stopped (aborted):  The activity has not been completed but no future action is planned</li>
 <li>completed: Work on the requested task has been completed, and no further action is required</li>
 <li>cancelled: The request has been withdrawn</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of the request/order life cycle:</p>
<ul>
 <li>CommunicationRequest.status:  <span title="Draft: The request has been created but is not yet complete or ready for action.">draft</span> | <span title="Active: The request is in force and ready to be acted upon.">active</span> | <span title="On Hold: The request (and any implicit authorization to act) has been temporarily withdrawn but is expected to resume in the future.">on-hold</span> | <span title="Revoked: The request (and any implicit authorization to act) has been terminated prior to the known full completion of the intended actions.  No further activity should occur.">revoked</span> | <span title="Completed: The activity described by the request has been fully performed.

<p>Clinical status is somewhat different than the previous status values, since it does not deal with workflow or lifecycle. Instead, it indicates how evidence is affecting a clinical interpretation. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus: <span title="Active: The subject is currently experiencing, or is at risk of, a reaction to the identified substance.">active</span> | <span title="Inactive: The subject is no longer at risk of a reaction to the identified substance.">inactive</span></li>
	<li>Condition.clinicalStatus: <span title="Active: The subject is currently experiencing the symptoms of the condition or there is evidence of the condition.">active</span> | <span title="Inactive: The subject is no longer experiencing the symptoms of the condition or there is no longer evidence of the condition.">inactive</span></li>

<p>
Many clinical systems maintain current lists of some kind of resources for a patient. Some of the commonly maintained lists include:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Current Problem List: a list of the problems that are of concern for care of the patient</li>
 <li>Current Medication List: a list of the medications that a patient is known to be on at the current time</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because of the way that resources are used, there is no simple way to determine, from
examination of a resource, whether it is 'current' or not. Take, as an example, the
<a href="condition.html">Condition</a> resource. In a typical EHR, condition resources
might be published on the RESTful interface for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>to represent an item in a patient's curated problem list</li>
 <li>to represent a complaint or a diagnosis from an encounter record</li>
 <li>to represent a problem for investigation provided by a diagnostic system as part of a <a href="servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a>/<a href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a> pair</li>
 <li>the resources were received from another system as part of a referral package, and were current for that system when they were received</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is no element on the Condition resource that can convey the difference between these usages. In particular, there can be
no way to differentiate between current and past resources without having to retrospectively alter resources, which is
problematic with regard to integrity and digital signatures.
</p>
<p>
One consequence of this is that searching the condition resource for a given patient will return more
than just the patient's current problems. Though this is somewhat counter-intuitive to some implementers,
restricting searches on Condition to only include the patient's current curated problem list excludes
all the other - important - uses of the Condition resource.
</p>
<p>
Determining whether a Condition is an entry on a patient's current problem list is done by checking
with the Condition resource is referenced from the correct list.
</p>
<p>
On the RESTful API, this is done using the <a href="search.html#current">list search mechanism</a>:
</p>
<pre>
 GET [base]/AllergyIntolerance?patient=42&amp;_list=$current-allergies
</pre>
<p>
This is a request to fetch all the allergies in the patient 42's "Current Problem List".
Note that the server is not required to actually make a resource representation of the current allergy list
available, though doing so assists clients in their audit/integrity tasks. See
<a href="list-operation-find.html">List Operation "Find"</a> for further information.
</p>
<p>
In a document, current lists are determined by the code on a Composition section.
</p>
<a name="lists"></a>

The entered-in-error state indicates the resource was created accidentally and
should be ignored. This state can apply to resources created by manual
entry. It is usually not associated with the Clinical Workflow Process life cycle,
but can be associated with the Request/Order and the Entity Availability life cycles.
