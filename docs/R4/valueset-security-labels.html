                           Usage Note: This metadata indicates that the receiver has no obligation to consider additional policies when making access control decisions.   Note that in some jurisdictions, personally identifiable information must be protected as confidential, so it would not be appropriate to assign a confidentiality code of "unrestricted"  to that information even if it is publicly available.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-Confidentiality-L"> </a><a href="v3/Confidentiality/cs.html#v3-Confidentiality-L">L</a></td><td>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-Confidentiality</td><td>low</td><td>Definition: Privacy metadata indicating that the information has been de-identified, and there are mitigating circumstances that prevent re-identification, which minimize risk of harm from unauthorized disclosure.  The information requires protection to maintain low sensitivity.

                        
                           Examples: Includes anonymized, pseudonymized, or non-personally identifiable information such as HIPAA limited data sets.

                        
                           Map: No clear map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (1) Care Management:   RECORD_COMPONENTs that might need to be accessed by a wide range of administrative staff to manage the subject of care's access to health services.

                        
                           Usage Note: This metadata indicates the receiver may have an obligation to comply with a data use agreement.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-Confidentiality-M"> </a><a href="v3/Confidentiality/cs.html#v3-Confidentiality-M">M</a></td><td>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-Confidentiality</td><td>moderate</td><td>Definition: Privacy metadata indicating moderately sensitive information, which presents moderate risk of harm if disclosed without authorization.

                        
                           Examples: Includes allergies of non-sensitive nature used inform food service; health information a patient authorizes to be used for marketing, released to a bank for a health credit card or savings account; or information in personal health record systems that are not governed under health privacy laws.

                        
                           Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (2) Clinical Management:  Less sensitive RECORD_COMPONENTs that might need to be accessed by a wider range of personnel not all of whom are actively caring for the patient (e.g. radiology staff).

                        
                           Usage Note: This metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with the receiver's terms of use or privacy policies.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-Confidentiality-N"> </a><a href="v3/Confidentiality/cs.html#v3-Confidentiality-N">N</a></td><td>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-Confidentiality</td><td>normal</td><td>Definition: Privacy metadata indicating that the information is typical, non-stigmatizing health information, which presents typical risk of harm if disclosed without authorization.

                        
                           Examples: In the US, this includes what HIPAA identifies as the minimum necessary protected health information (PHI) given a covered purpose of use (treatment, payment, or operations).  Includes typical, non-stigmatizing health information disclosed in an application for health, workers compensation, disability, or life insurance.

                        
                           Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care:   Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR).   Maps to normal confidentiality for treatment information but not to ancillary care, payment and operations.

                        
                           Usage Note: This metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-Confidentiality-R"> </a><a href="v3/Confidentiality/cs.html#v3-Confidentiality-R">R</a></td><td>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-Confidentiality</td><td>restricted</td><td>Privacy metadata indicating highly sensitive, potentially stigmatizing information, which presents a high risk to the information subject if disclosed without authorization. May be pre-empted by jurisdictional law, e.g., for public health reporting or emergency treatment.

                        
                           Examples: Includes information that is additionally protected such as sensitive conditions mental health, HIV, substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, genetic disease, and reproductive health; or sensitive demographic information such as a patient's standing as an employee or a celebrity.

                           Usage Note: Access control schemes are the type of access control policy, which is comprised of access control policy rules concerning the provision of the access control service.

                        There are two categories of access control policies, rule-based and identity-based, which are identified in CCITT Rec. X.800 aka ISO 7498-2. Rule-based access control policies are intended to apply to all access requests by any initiator on any target in a security domain. Identity-based access control policies are based on rules specific to an individual initiator, a group of initiators, entities acting on behalf of initiators, or originators acting in a specific role. Context can modify rule-based or identity-based access control policies. Context rules may define the entire policy in effect. Real systems will usually employ a combination of these policy types; if a rule-based policy is used, then an identity-based policy is usually in effect also.

                        An access control scheme may be based on access control lists, capabilities, labels, and context or a combination of these.  An access control scheme is a component of an access control mechanism or "service") along with the supporting mechanisms required by that scheme to provide access control decision information (ADI) supplied by the scheme to the access decision facility (ADF also known as a PDP). (Based on ISO/IEC 10181-3:1996)

A delegation policy thus specifies an authorisation to delegate. Subjects must already possess the access rights to be delegated.

                        Delegation policies are aimed at subjects delegating rights to servers or third parties to perform actions on their behalf and are not meant to be the means by which security administrators would assign rights to subjects. A negative delegation policy identifies what delegations are forbidden.

                        A Delegation policy specifies the authorisation policy from which delegated rights are derived, the grantors, which are the entities which can delegate these access rights, and the grantees, which are the entities to which the access rights can be delegated.

                        The goal is to clearly differentiate this type of coordination of care from HIPAA Operations by specifying that these actions on information are undertaken in the provision of healthcare treatment.

                        For similar uses of this concept, see SAMHSA Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, which differentiates concepts of care coordination and case management for the provision of treatment as specifically distinct from activities related to health care delivery management and the operations of organizational entities involved in the delivery of healthcare.

Purpose 1 is equivalent to HL7 treatment purpose of use: "Clinical care provision to an individual subject of care" described as "To inform persons or processes responsible for providing health care services to the subject of care."
The ISO description conflates both of the proposed specializations of HL7 ETREAT: break the glass and the typically broader access to health information normally available to providers who are provisioned for emergency workflows on a regular basis, e.g., Emergency Room providers. Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent.  This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.</td></tr><tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><a name="http---terminology.hl7.org-CodeSystem-v3-ActReason-ERTREAT"> </a><a href="v3/ActReason/cs.html#v3-ActReason-ERTREAT">ERTREAT</a></td><td>http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActReason</td><td>emergency room treatment</td><td>To perform one or more operations on information for provision of immediately needed health care for an emergent condition in an emergency room or similar emergent care context by end users provisioned for this purpose, which does not constitute as policy override such as in a "Break the Glass" purpose of use.
